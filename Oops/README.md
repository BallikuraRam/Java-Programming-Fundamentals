Inheritance : 
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where one class 
(the child or derived class) inherits the properties and methods of another class 
(the parent or base class). 
The child class can then use and extend the functionality of the parent class without 
having to redefine everything from scratch.
